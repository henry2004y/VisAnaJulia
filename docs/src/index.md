# VisAna.jl Documentation

## Overview

!!! note
    This package is still under development, so be careful for any future breaking changes!

[SWMF](http://csem.engin.umich.edu/tools/swmf) data reading, converting, visualizing and analyzing using Julia.

This package is inherited from its predecessor in IDL (developed by G.TÃ³th) and Matlab (developed by H.Zhou). Currently instead of a real "package", this is more like a collection of scripts. The data loader and converter is split into an stand-alone package [Batsrus.jl](https://github.com/henry2004y/Batsrus.jl).

This package provides the following functionalities:
  * SWMF simulation data visualization
    * phase space distribution
    * 2D slices of 3D data, including all common plots
    * log variable plots
  * data analysis in space physics
    * magnetic field comparison with satellite data
    * spectral analysis
    * minimum variance analysis
    * wave analysis

The ultimate goal is to build a convenient tool of reading and analyzing simulation outputs which is easy to install, easy to use, and fast.

## Installation
Install VisAna from the `julia REPL` prompt with
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/henry2004y/VisAnaJulia", rev="master"))
```

```@contents
Pages = [
    "man/log.md",
    "man/examples.md",
    "man/functions.md",
    "man/types.md",
    "man/analysis.md"
    "man/trace.md"
    "man/text.md"
]

```

## Benchmark

VisAna has by far the fastest data loading speed among IDL, MATLAB, and Julia.
It has almost the same performance as [spacepy](https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy).
Check the [table](https://henry2004y.github.io/Batsrus.jl/dev/#Benchmark) for details.

## Developers

VisAna is developed by [Hongyang Zhou](https://github.com/henry2004y).
